CVE: CVE-2010-3248
CWE: 
announced: 2010-09-07 14:00:02.557000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Before a certain version of chrome, a bug existed which did not properly retrict
  javascript from copying to the clipboard from any context (e.g a timer event). The
  person who found the vulnerability, wrote an exploit that would hijack the clipboard
  by constantly setting its content to a malicious urls.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: There were no automated tests to prevent this before it was discovered.
  code: Unit tests were used
  fix: They decided to have an option in settings which would allow JS access to the clipboard (default false).
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: Found by a google employee who found this vulnerability by 'adding an IFrame containing a text input element into the document, and turning its design-mode / content-editable on'
  date: 2010-04-15
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: webkit
  name: webkit
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 98b5bcbd5136888ee6a6d63b5e2d69c85865a86a
    note: |
      This is the only commit related to the vulnerability is the vccs.
      after it was discovered, it was a relatively quick and easy fix.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The Dev team must have been busy, but there are no comments until the fix was
    completed 2.5 weeks later. It appears that other issues were merged into this
    one as well.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      It's reasonable to assume that you couldn't access the clipboard outside of
      clipboard events. The only way to for someone to find this vulnerability would
      be if they had an intimate knowledge of the system and or is incredibly creative.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This bug was not present in Opera or Firefox, so it was a reasonable assumption that
    someone couldn't access the clipboard outside dedicated clipboard events. This is one
    of those important but very obscure vulnerabilities that are hard to actively defend against.
    The only way to prevent these kind of vulnerabilities, would to be paranoid about every feature
    and have unit tests out the whazoo. While testing your code into the ground is a good way to
    ensure it's safety, I'd say it wouldn't be economical to write software this way at all.
